If you have Aegis, your temporary barrier is no longer temporary.

This makes the barrier you get from Aegis actually stick around as opposed to immediately decaying.\
Also helps any other source of Barrier such as Topaz Brooches.\
This does not make Aegis itself that strong. You will still need on hit or excessive healing but it makes it more unique.
